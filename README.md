# PVLV

## This program has since been superseeded by [VieweD](https://github.com/ZeromusXYZ/VieweD), please use that instead.

This program is meant to be used with .log files made with the Windower4 Packetviewer add-on.
It is also able to read Ashita Packeteer .txt log files, and with PacketDB .sqlite3 files.

The program should be pretty straight forward to use for anybody for who it would be usefull.

The end idea is to make a program that can mimic the track function for the original addon, but in a offline fashion by parsing the log files

This is a port of my [PacketViewerLogViewer in Delphi](https://github.com/ZeromusXYZ/PVLV-Delphi-Old)
This program borrows some parts of Windower's [POLUtils project](https://github.com/Windower/POLUtils) to load data directly from the game client.
